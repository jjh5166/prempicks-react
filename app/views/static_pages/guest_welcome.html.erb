    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>
      This app was created to run a picks league for the English Premier League. The league was previously run in a shared
      spreadsheet which required manual entry for anything that a myriad of v-lookups couldnâ€™t handle. Today, there is a fully
      functional application built on the Ruby on Rails framework.

    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>
      Users pick a team each week with the goal of scoring the most points based on the customized rules set. There are no
      repeat picks per half of the season. The deadline to make a pick for each week of games is the kick off of the first
      match, after which the selection is locked and a team is automatically assigned. A more in-depth explanation of the
      rules is available <a href="/rules">here</a>.

      The app utilizes Postgres for its database. In addition to user data, league data is stored which is referenced to
      control visibility and DOM interaction. The backend handles updates to the database with the use of scheduled jobs
      through Sidekiq. The API is monitored for new match data and when new updates are available, subsequent jobs are
      initiated to perform tasks based on the response. The scoring algorithm is written in a <a href="https://github.com/jjh5166/epl-scoring-script" target="_blank">Python script</a>, which fetches
      data, calculates scores and saves a JSON file on Amazon S3.
